This project is still underway
It is a desktop pet made tkinter and python, it uses gifs frames as the animation
For now the animation is random as I want the pet to seem autonomous, but the loops run at quite a fast rate, due to the inconsistency of the number of frames per gif, each animation frame loops through 8 gif frames.
I would make methods available for each animation and delay the animation time in the future.
This is a preview ofeach pet used. This is peach [Peach Preview](assets/taps.gif)
This is a preview of goma [Goma Preview](assets/goma_dives.gif).
THis is a preview of both of 'em.[Both Pets](assets/both_bites.gif)
I made a little menu to give options of which pet appears on the screen I used only one label forthe tkinter window so it's not advisable to select both pets at the same time
to see both pets on screen, click the both option. Preview of menu [Menu Preview](assets/main_menu.png)
